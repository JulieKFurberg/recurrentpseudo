Description: This package computes one-, two- and three-dimensional 
    pseudo-observations based on recurrent events and terminal events. 
    Generalised linear models are fitted using generalised estimating 
    equations. Technical details on the bivariate procedure can be found 
    in `Bivariate pseudo-observations for recurrent event analysis with 
    terminal events' (Furberg et al., 2021).
